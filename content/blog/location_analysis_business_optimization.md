Ever wondered how Starbucks or McDonalds decide on where their next location should be? What are the factors to consider when trying to make this decision? While the consequences of setting up shop in a disadvantageous location could be damaging to the bottom line for these giants, the repercussions could be much more dire for small businesses. In this blog post, I will aim to highlight the kind of data that you can work with, and provide some insight into how you could leverage this information along with data-science and artificial intelligence techniques. The goal is to help companies make more informed decisions when it comes to matching your business to the right location.  

**Full Disclosure:** I recently completed this project for a Vancouver based company, however, my NDA will prevent me from getting into certain specifics. 

Coming Soon...
